Unlike his war with Disney, conservative outrage against AB InBev came well before DeSantis decided to take action against the Belgium beermaker. Right-wing influencers and celebrities helped fuel widespread boycotts against the company’s top brand, Bud Light, after it sponsored Mulvaney, a trans advocate famous on TikTok for her bubbly and positive posts. She posted a brief digital ad for the company for NCAA March Madness this year and the brand sent her a personalized can with her face on it. Amid the fallout, Modelo Especial became the top-selling beer in May, overthrowing Bud Light from the top spot it held for more than two decades, according to NIQ data given to consulting firm Bump Williams. In June, Modelo Especial captured 8.7% of overall beer sales, compared to Bud Light’s 7% share. Bud Light sales, in dollars, have recently tumbled by about 25% year-over-year, according to the data shared by Williams. Sales have slumped despite the company’s efforts to distance itself from controversy. “We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer,” A-B CEO Brendan Whitworth said in an April 14 statement. Soon after the statement was issued, the company said that two marketing vice presidents had taken leaves of absence. Whitworth later laid out a plan to provide financial assistance to its wholesalers to help offset falling sales, and reimburse fuel for distributors’ trucks, among other things. Bud Light’s summer ad campaign includes partnerships with country singers and new ads featuring NFL players. A recent 60-second spot shows people enjoying Bud Light despite facing some of summer’s biggest pain points, like sunburn or a sudden thunderstorm during a cook out. However, DeSantis’ actions on Thursday signaled Republicans are not done using the company as a punching bag as they seek to gain favor with the party’s base. The move against Bud Light also served as another reminder that DeSantis as a sitting governor can use the power of the state to weigh in on the issues animating Republican voters, an advantage he holds over a 2024 primary field that includes many people not currently in office, including his top rival, former President Donald Trump. As it charts a course down the middle, Bud Light has lost credibility among members of the LGBTQ+ community who are dismayed by the brand’s handling of the backlash against its minor partnership with Mulvaney. Because of that, Bud Light hasn’t gotten the benefit of a so-called buycott campaign, which can help buoy sales when brands are hit by calls for a boycott. Earlier this year, DeSantis praised conservative consumers for boycotting the company, telling the right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson: “I’ll never drink Bud again.” “Corporate America is trying to change our country, trying to change policy, trying to change culture. And, you know, I’d rather be governed by ‘we the people’ than companies,” DeSantis said in the interview. “And so I think pushback is in order across the board, including with Bud Light.” The staying power of the boycott remains to be seen. DeSantis, for example, told Johnson he and his wife prefer another beer: “We actually like the stout, Guinness.” Yet, a decade ago, the Irish beer brand became a target of conservative ire when it pulled its sponsorship of New York’s St. Patrick’s Day over the exclusion of LGBTQ groups. In response, the Catholic League called for a boycott of Guinness.
